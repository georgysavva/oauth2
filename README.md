# ELSA Challenge for backend/integrations developer

This is Elsa’s Coding Exercise. It allows Elsa to assess candidates’ ability to develop well structured, maintainable and useful code. The code does not need to be fancy, but needs to represent the coding skills of the candidate, and it will be the basis for discussions on the technical interview. 

You can start this any time you like. It should not take you more than 1 day to code. You can turn it in at any time. As you think about this exercise, please feel to ask questions!

Please Fork this repo and submit your solution in the fork

Happy coding!

## Problem 
{state problem: needs to be something that involves python coding in classes, integrating some API (hopefully payment or something similar, that has several steps. One of those that have a callback would be nice).}

## Basic Functionality

{list of functionality items the code should do.}
{documentation on how to use it}

## Optional Extras 

(These are ideas. You are not obligated to implement any of these. We prefer to see an app with limited feature set and quality code, as opposed to an app with more features that is hacked together)

{maybe for him to dockerize the code?}
{maybe for him to do a full implementation, with nginx+gunicorn, ...}
